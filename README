As start, sync Cyanogen Mod sources like described on
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus_(GSM):_Compile_CyanogenMod_(Linux)
make sure you are using "-b ics" in "repo init" instead of "-b jellybean" or even "-b cm-10.1" described on source sync part.

When done, copy whole acer folder to [your CM path]/device.
Copy kernel folder to [your CM path]/kernel. Kernel could be found here: https://github.com/Nikolas-LFDesigns/cm_device_a4_kernel/tree/ics. Automatic loading will come later.
Patch folder comes in cm tree root so that it could determine a working folder without hardcoding it.

PREPARING BUILD:
plug in your Metal (make sure that you have latest rom and adb is set up) and fire up extract-files.sh;
Patch build system with PatchBuild.sh to make some device-specific tweaks;
then we can continue :)
To build CM, just follow next instruction:
in terminal:
cd [your CM path]
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch a4

then, when build is ready, you could find it in $OUT dir.
